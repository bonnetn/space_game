1. Apparently some faraway ships' parts render only when on EyeTrace's line.
2. When moving, projection of ships weirds out in some cases (especially moving up and down) and makes them jump from one place to another.
3. The HUD does not agree with reality when rotated.
4. Pockets don't work on singleplayer.
5. Third person camera acts weird when ship is rotated.
6. Third person camera still doesn't quite work when it comes to rendering other ships (they intersect with the driven ship or render on top of it sometimes).
7. Empty ships stay after pocketization is undone, you can pocketize TP'ed props as if they are not a spaceship and yet afterwards, they occupy the same ID as before.

Nth. There are probably a lot more to be discovered.
